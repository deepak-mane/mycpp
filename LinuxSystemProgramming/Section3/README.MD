# Section 3 : Preprocessing Directives


So guys welcome back in this more we will going to study pre-processing directives in C and C++ So we will understand the working of pre-processing directives by following the following part. 

- First of all we will discuss the problem of duplicate inclusion of header files.
- Then we will learn that what are pre-processing directives and how do they work.
- And then we will try to see that how the solution to duplicate inclusion of header files could be resolved using preprocessor directives.

So this will give you a clear insight regarding how pre-processing directives work and when should you use pre-processing directives going forward. 

Let us try to understand the problem of duplicate inclusion of header file.

So most of the times we end up including the same header file into the source file multiple times this

resulted in duplicate text substitution so reserved is the completion error.
