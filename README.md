### Key Points for Best Practices for Writing Code
1. Start each program with a description of what it does.
1. Then load all required packages.
1. Consider what working directory you are in when sourcing a script.
1. Use comments to mark off sections of code.
1. Put function definitions at the top of your file, or in a separate file if there are many.
1. Name and style code consistently.
1. Break code into small, discrete pieces.
1. Factor out common operations rather than repeating them.
1. Keep all of the source files for a project in one directory and use relative paths to access them.
1. Keep track of the memory used by your program.
1. Always start with a clean environment instead of saving the workspace.
1. Keep track of session information in your project folder.
1. Have someone else review your code.
1. Use version control.
